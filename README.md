# Korone Character Mod   
## Description   
This mod is for the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/)   
It replaces the default character with [Inugami Korone](https://x.com/inugamikorone)   

The animation sprites were rendered with [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/)  
All animations were hand made with love and care, as the model import removed all physics
